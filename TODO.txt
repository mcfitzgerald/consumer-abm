02-15-24 :: handle exception where ad dict is empty; could be made into the ads off toggle too
05-02-24 :: Components of purchase history functions are hardcoded -- make configurable and add to config file, also add option to turn off
05-05-24 :: Add capability to add/remove agents during simulation (people entering and exiting market)
           Example code:
           def step(self):
             # Add a new agent at each step
             new_agent = ConsumerAgent(self.next_id(), self)
             self.schedule.add(new_agent)

5-05-24 :: remove depth and frequency attributes from agent class config logic and config file
5-06-24 :: have not observed "buy none" behavior - suggests that other logic prevents this or consumer always buys, which is suspect
